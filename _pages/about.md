I am an early-career Atmospheric and Big Data scientist passionate about unraveling the intricate interactions among Earth's spheres and their impact on health. Currently serving as a Teaching and Research Assistant under the guidance of Dr. Edmund Yamba at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana, I earned my bachelor's degree in Meteorology and Climate Science from the same institution.

Proficient in high and low-level programming languages—Python, R, Fortran, and shell—I leverage my skills to analyze data from various sources, including satellites, climate models, and atmospheric reanalysis.

Feel free to delve into my research projects and interests on this website.
