        <h2>YESS Community</h2>
        <p>Exciting News! I've been accepted into the Young Earth System Scientists (YESS) community. YESS strives to shape the future of Earth system science by fostering international and transdisciplinary leaders of tomorrow. I'm thrilled to be part of this vibrant community of Early Career Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of Earth system sciences.</p>
        
        <p>YESS focuses on academia but also welcomes members from other sectors related to Earth system science, including researchers and young professionals in governmental institutes, NGOs, public outreach institutions, and the private sector.</p>
        
        <p>Looking forward to contributing to a more equitable and sustainable future through collaborative research and knowledge development!</p>
