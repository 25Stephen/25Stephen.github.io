    <h2>Knust Research Assistantship Position with Dr. Edmund I. Yamba (2022-Present)</h2>
    <p>Worked on Climate-based distribution of seasonal malaria transmission over Ghana.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigated the current and future distribution of malaria in Ghana under extreme case climate change scenarios namely: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5.</li>
        <li>Used modelled data from ICTP RegCM4 and HadGEM2 RCM and GCM outputs and CHIRPS, ERA-5, and CRU products. Implemented the VECTRI model by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Worked on Impacts of global warming: Rethinking Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examining the rate of warming in the northern regions of Ghana and their effects on health and livelihood.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Worked on Mapping seasonal malaria transmission risk, a function of climate and environment using entomological indices of Temperature on the Vectorial Capacity of Malaria.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reviewed current literature and discovered setbacks in available research works.</li>
        <li>Implemented Python-based techniques to compute the vectorial capacity and the survival probabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>KNUST JNAA Research Lab with Dr. Jefferey Aryee (September 2020-2022)</h2>
    <p>Worked on Using multiple drought metrics to assess climatic drought and floods.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extracted, explored, and processed 100GB gridded data computed the RAI, SAI, and SPI.</li>
        <li>Examined the efficacy of gridded precipitation datasets namely; CRU, CHIRPS, and GPCC in predicting drought and flood occurrences using several drought metrics.</li>
        <li>Computed the RAI, SAI, and SPI-3 on the gridded and observed datasets.</li>
    </ul>
